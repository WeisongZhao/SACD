`SACD result of fluctuation images and comparison between SACD and SRRF using live-cell imaging data.` <br />
(a) Mean wide-field image, <br />
(b) SRRF reconstructed image with 200 frames, <br />
(c) SRRF reconstructed image with 16 frames SACD recons-tructed image, <br />
(d) SACD reconstructed image,<br /> 
(e) Right: MPAC and error map between MPAC and AC image; left: SACD reconstructed image without first and second deconvolution step. (f) Normalized line profiles taken from the regions between the yellow arrowheads for corresponding images in (a), (b) and (d) showing separated features. <br />
Scale bar 1.5 Î¼m. AC: auto-correlation.
